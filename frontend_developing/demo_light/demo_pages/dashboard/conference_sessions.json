Artist Alex Reben uses robots and AI as executors of his conceptual works, a means to an end that couldn't have been achieved without the use of this technology. Catie Cuan develops interactions with robots, by first designing the robot to move and feel in a way that complements her vision, and then the way she and the audience experience that interaction builds further on her creative voice. And BREAKFAST transforms real-time data from the natural world to tell stories through his kinetic artworks.

The response to the brief to their partners at T&Pm took a team of combined talents and disciplines, to design a compelling consumer proposition, backed by an innovative technical solution, and robust safety layers.  \n\nWe will share some of the key organizational lessons learned as they worked to deliver such an ambitious campaign. Responsibility was paramount, and we'll share how we did a mass participative activation with zero harmful interactions.  See how we created a generative AI engine for Mars, Inc. that redefines personalized storytelling and brand building. Using custom language models, we crafted on-brand, funny scripts, then paired them with voice and video tech to generate unique content for each consumer. Finally, we'll discuss how this approach will shape consumer packaged goods marketing in the future, as we apply personalized storytelling to new markets and brands — demonstrating the power of innovation through generative AI.",

Potentially, with a large ensemble, one could better understand and quantify the likelihood of heavy precipitation, which has some modulation from large-scale weather patterns.

Building on TruLens, our open-source project, we'll also present a methodology for evaluating, experiment tracking, and monitoring agentic apps that enables developers to measure app quality, identify and debug failure modes, and build the trust that’s needed to move apps into production and keep them there. Specifically, we'll share our recent research on agentic text-to-SQL that placed No. 1 on the Spider 2.0-Snow leaderboard (in January 2025) and optimizing LLM judges that yields up to 15% improvement in their precision — i.e., true positive agreement with human evaluators.",

The field has evolved through multiple hypotheses, beginning with search as a solution, followed by knowledge-based systems, and, most recently, leveraging large language models for robotics. Yet, the challenge of creating generalist embodied agents capable of performing thousands of tasks across diverse environments remains unsolved. Building such a generalist robotic agent presents a \"chicken-and-egg\" problem: to train agents for generalization, we need vast amounts of robotic/agent data from varied environments, but gathering such data is impractical without deploying robots/agents that already generalize. I propose a new framework that leverages alternative sources of \"indirect\" supervision to build robotic agents from the ground up. I'll focus on three key principles: (1) How to generate self-supervised data for training robots? (2) How to bootstrap robot learning by observing human videos? and (3) How can robots learn to adapt via large-scale training in simulation? I'll demonstrate this framework's potential for scaling robotics AI through several case studies.",

This might lead to hallucinations in content generation, which requires up-to-date or domain-specific information. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) addresses this issue by enabling LLMs to access external context without modifying model parameters. Embedding or dense retrieval models are a key component of a RAG pipeline for retrieving relevant context to the LLM. However, an embedding model’s effectiveness to capture the unique characteristics of the custom data hinges on the quality and domain relevance of its training data. Fine-tuning embedding models is gaining interest to provide more accurate and relevant responses tailored to users’ specific domain.In this lab, you'll learn to generate a synthetic dataset with question-context pairs from a domain-specific corpus, and process the data for fine-tuning. Then, fine-tune a text embedding model using synthetic data and evaluate it.Prerequisite(s):Basic knowledge of LLMs, TensorFlow/Pytorch and Python programming is required.Intermediate-level understanding of ML/DL and NLP pipelines.",

CuDNN remains a core library for DL primitives in popular frameworks such as PyTorch, JAX, Tensorflow, and many more while covering training, fine-tuning, and inference use cases.  Even in the rapidly evolving space of Gen AI — be it Llama, Gemma, or mixture-of-experts variants requiring complex DL primitives such as flash attention variants — cuDNN is powering them all.\n\nLearn about new/updated APIs of cuDNN pertaining to Blackwell’s microscaling format, and how to program against those APIs. We'll deep dive into leveraging its graph APIs to build some fusion patterns, such as matmul fusion patterns and fused flash attention from state-of-the-art models.

To strike this issue, we devise three key techniques: A fine-grained sparse attention algorithm for the pre-filling phase, equipped by a high-performance token-sparsity attention kernel using Tensor Core with CUTLASS CUTE, which delivers an 8X speedup at a 10X sparse rate without sacrificing accuracy; block-sparsity attention for the decoding phase, which further doubles the sparse rate while preserving accuracy with novel KV cache clustering; dynamic chunked pipeline parallelism, which decomposes a long sequence into chunks with adaptively updated chunk size based on an analytical cost model to balance pipeline stages, resulting in about 2X acceleration over Tensor Parallelism on eight GPUs. The above optimizations have empowered over 20X and 4X speedups for the pre-filling and decoding phases, respectively, while preserving accuracy with context length of 1 million tokens.",

                "description": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines are revolutionizing enterprise operations. However, most existing tutorials stop at proof-of-concept implementations that falter when scaling. This workshop aims to bridge that gap, focusing on building scalable, production-ready RAG pipelines powered by NVIDIA NIM microservices and Kubernetes. Participants will gain hands-on experience deploying, monitoring, and scaling RAG pipelines with the NIM Operator and learn best practices for infrastructure optimization, performance monitoring, and handling high traffic volumes.The workshop begins by building a simple RAG pipeline using the NVIDIA API catalog. Participants will deploy and test individual components in a local environment using Docker Compose. Once familiar with the basics, the focus will shift to deploying NIMs, such as LLM, NeMo Retriever Text Embedding, and NeMo Retriever Text Reranking, in a Kubernetes cluster using the NIM Operator. This will include managing the deployment, monitoring, and scalability of NVIDIA NIM microservices. Building on these deployments, the workshop will cover constructing a production-grade RAG pipeline using the deployed NIMs and explore NVIDIA's blueprint for PDF ingestion, learning how to integrate it into the RAG pipeline.To ensure operational efficiency, the workshop will introduce Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring pipeline performance, cluster health, and resource utilization. Scalability will be addressed through the use of the Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for dynamically scaling NIMs based on custom metrics in conjunction with the NIM Operator. Custom dashboards will be created to visualize key metrics and interpret performance insights.You’ll be able to:Build a simple RAG pipeline using API endpoints, deployed locally with Docker Compose.Deploy a variety of NVIDIA NIM microservices in a Kubernetes cluster using the NIM Operator.Combine NIMs into a cohesive, production-grade RAG pipeline and integrate advanced data ingestion workflows.Monitor RAG pipelines and Kubernetes clusters with Prometheus and Grafana.Scale NIMs to handle high traffic using the NIM Operator.Create, deploy, and scale RAG pipelines for a variety of agentic workflows, including PDF ingestion.Prerequisite(s):Familiarity working with LLM-based applications.Familiarity with RAG pipelines.Familiarity working with Kubernetes.Familiarity working with Helm.Certificate:Upon successful completion of the assessment, you’ll receive an NVIDIA certificate to recognize your subject matter competency and support your professional career growth.",

Unlike holistic evaluations of RAG applications, real-time solutions must introduce minimal latency and offer a high degree of live adaptation and reasoning. To ensure the live observability of large language models (LLMs), we use \"LLMs as a judge,\" where the reliability of the answers provided by one LLM is re-evaluated by another LLM before being returned as the system’s output. A common pitfall in \"LLM as a judge\" applications is that models tend to prefer their own answers, and thus undermine a system’s trustworthiness. To provide a first-of-its-class solution to this problem in the heavily-regulated banking industry, we adopt NVIDIA’s NIMs to deploy an open-source model as the LLM judge and extend it with observability tools from NeMo Guardrails and Evaluator.",

Our method, FlashAttention-3, achieves speedup on H100 GPUs by 1.5-2.0X, with BF16 reaching up to 800 TFLOPs/s, and with FP8 reaching1.3 PFLOPs/s.

This new cut was discovered during renovations 53 years later, changing our understanding of the film. Hopefully, most media companies don’t store in janitor’s closets, but most have hundreds of thousands of hours of footage sitting dormant, stored with little more information than the file name.\n\nLearn how using a NIMS-based contextual analysis for metadata ingest within a software-defined broadcast pipeline can make your active media and archive searchable by a frame’s visual contents, and even the greater context around it. These data allow for dynamic and novel opportunities for monetization and personalization. We'll discuss how contextual metadata can be produced and refined recursively within a TAMS (time-addressable media) framework to add and amend metadata each time footage is retrieved. These data can be used to generate retrieval-augmented generation models for everything from anomaly detection to predictive/suggestive editing and FAST-content generation. \nDiscover how a news organization will use metadata to “Control F” through their archive, and how a racing company will use their contextual data to create models to predict camera switching, improve safety, and generate user-specific narratives. We’ll close with an exploration of how media & entertainment (M&E) contextual data pipelines can be used outside our industry, from avoiding collisions with self-driving cars to sonar analysis.",

With this, for the first time, independent software vendors (ISVs), operating systems (OS) vendors, and developers can deploy and orchestrate services with ease, as well as onboarding these tools to their environment. In this session, OS and ISV partner companies who've adopted the DPF will share their experience, what they are able to achieve, and what comes next.",

This is both to the ease with which the GPU can be programmed and their computational efficiency. \n\nMoreover, GPU-based 5G and 6G RAN stacks can run coherently with the code of a new class of simulation tools: digital twins. The efficiency with which the GPU can run both physics simulation chains as well as the 5G/6G RAN stack enable simulations to reach new scales and levels of accuracy.

                "description": "医薬品開発には15年もの歳月と2000億ともいわれる莫大な費用が掛かる上、30,000化合物に1つが医薬品として世に出るという成功確率の低さから、あらゆる角度からの効率化が望まれて久しい。近年では、効率化のアプローチの一つとして、電子カルテや研究論文情報、化合物の構造や評価データなどの膨大な情報を利用したAI創薬に大きな期待が集まっている。ただ、入手可能な学習ソ－スである膨大なデータは、多様かつ再現性が低いなどの様々な課題があり、結果不正確なデータで学習せざるを得ない創薬AIは、期待されたパフォーマンスを出せていない。\n一方で、シミュレーションが作るシンセティックデータによるAI学習は、自動運転など多くの分野ですでに実用化されており、AIの性能を飛躍的に上げることが知られているが、創薬分野では質と量を兼ね備えたシミュレーション手法がなかったため、実用化に至っていなかった。\n今回、我々は既存の最新の手法に比べ数百から数千倍高速で高精度、かつリファレンスデータの不要な革新的な化合物活性予測シミュレーターを開発した。本セッションでは、この技術の概要・特徴と、AI創薬への応用について議論したい。From discovery to the clinic, drug development takes about 15 years and costs a huge amount of money, said to be around 200 billion yen, while the success rate is low, with only one in 30,000 compounds reaching the market. Therefore, there has long been a need for efficiency at all stages of the process. In recent years, as one approach to efficiency, high expectation have been placed on AI drug discovery models that use huge amounts of data, such as electronic medical records, research paper information, and compound structure and evaluation data. However, the huge amount of data that is available as a training resource for the AI models has various issues, including diversity and low reproducibility. As a result, drug discovery AI that has no choice but to learn from inaccurate data does not perform as expected. On the other hand, AI learning using synthetic data created by simulation has already been put to practical use in many fields such as autonomous driving, and is known to dramatically improve the performance of AI, but in the drug discovery field, there has been no simulation method that combined quality and quantity, so it has not been put to practical use. We have developed an innovative compound activity prediction simulator that is hundreds to thousands of times faster than existing state-of-the-art methods while still maintaining high accuracy and with the additional benefit that it does not require reference data. In this session, we would like to discuss the overview and features of this technology and its application to AI drug discovery.",

                "description": "Hardware design presents numerous challenges due to its complexity and rapidly advancing technologies. These challenges result in longer turnaround times (TAT) for optimizing performance, power, area, and cost (PPAC) during synthesis, verification, physical design, and reliability loops. Large language models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to comprehend and generate natural language at scale, leading to numerous potential applications and benefits across various domains. Successful LLM-based agents for hardware design can significantly reduce TAT, enabling faster product cycles, lower costs, improved design reliability, and a reduced risk of costly errors. Cutting-edge multi-AI agents have shown promising results in Hardware Description Language (HDL) generation, layout optimization, design rule code generation, and Multi-Corner Multi-Mode (MCMM) timing report analysis and debugging at both the block and path levels. Notably, the developed multi-AI agents not only achieve a 94.2% functionally correct pass rate on the VerilogEval-Human v2 benchmark, but also deliver a 60X speedup in MCMM timing report analysis compared to experienced human engineers.",

We introduce a novel inference pattern, Writing in the Margins (WiM), specifically designed to address this issue. WiM innovatively utilizes a chunked prefill of the key-value cache, enabling segment-wise inference that significantly enhances the handling of extensive contexts. This method facilitates the generation and classification of intermediate information, termed \"margins,\" which strategically guide the model toward accomplishing specific tasks. To further optimize this process, we integrate WiM with TensorRT, a high-performance deep learning inference platform. This combination allows for the efficient execution of LLMs by leveraging TensorRT’s capabilities to accelerate computational processes and reduce latency.",
